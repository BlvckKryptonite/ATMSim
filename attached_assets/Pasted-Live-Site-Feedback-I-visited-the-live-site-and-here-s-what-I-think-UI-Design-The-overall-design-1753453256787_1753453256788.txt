Live Site Feedback
I visited the live site, and here's what I think:

UI Design:

The overall design is clean and straightforward, which works well for a functional ATM simulator. It's easy to navigate, and the layout doesn't feel cluttered.

Login Screen: The username/PIN input is simple, but adding some visual cues like icons or a bit of styling on the input fields would improve user experience (UX).

Dashboard: Once logged in, the dashboard is intuitive. However, consider adding more details (e.g., account number) to make the interface feel more like a real banking app.

Transaction History: This section is great for displaying the user’s activities. Adding a bit of animation or a smoother transition when switching between transactions could make the experience more engaging.

Functionality:

Login Simulation: The login process works fine, and it’s realistic. You can consider adding a "forgot PIN" feature to enhance the simulation.

Balance Viewing/Transactions: The transactions (deposit/withdrawal) work as expected. I like the balance update in real-time after each action. Adding a feature like a currency dropdown for multi-currency display could make it even better.

Receipt Generation: If you haven't done so already, consider adding a receipt pop-up or a downloadable PDF receipt after each transaction. It will make the simulation feel even more complete.

UX/UI Enhancements:

Animations: Add subtle animations to the action buttons or transaction history. For example, a small fade-in effect when the user logs in or makes a transaction can enhance the UI.

Visuals: Consider adding a background image or a theme that resembles an actual ATM environment. This can help users feel more immersed in the experience.

Error Handling: Adding error handling (e.g., incorrect PIN, insufficient funds, etc.) with appropriate messages would improve UX.

GitHub Repository Feedback
Your repo structure is organized, but here are a few points to consider:

README.md:

Ensure your README.md is comprehensive and gives clear instructions for setting up and running the project. Include steps for local development, deployment (like Vercel), and dependencies.

Consider adding a Features section to highlight the key functionality (e.g., login simulation, multi-currency support, etc.).

A screenshot of the app or a GIF showing the app in action could make your README more appealing.

Code Quality:

Backend (Express.js): The code looks clean, but consider breaking down the logic into smaller functions or controllers for better scalability and maintainability.

Frontend (React): You're using React well. Consider moving some logic into custom hooks for a cleaner and more modular approach, especially if you plan on adding more features.

Security: If this app will be used in production or publicly available, ensure that you’re hashing any sensitive data (like PINs) to prevent leaks.

Project Documentation:

Make sure to document the major functions and routes in your code, especially the logic behind transactions. It’ll help others who read your code understand the flow.

Final Thoughts
Polish: The ATM Simulator looks solid and works as expected, but adding some subtle animations, styling improvements, and error handling will polish it further.

Portfolio Addition: This is definitely a great project to add to your portfolio. It showcases your understanding of both frontend and backend development. To make it stand out even more, I’d suggest writing a case study or project blog explaining your challenges and how you solved them. It will help future clients or employers understand your problem-solving approach.
