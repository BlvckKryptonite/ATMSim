Full-Stack ATM Simulator
Project Goal:
Develop a polished, full-stack ATM Simulator with a clean UI using React and Next.js for the frontend and Python for the backend. This will simulate an ATM environment where users can securely log in, view their balances, deposit/withdraw money, and generate transaction receipts. The app will use a combination of fake user data and simulated banking features, including multiple accounts, transactions, and multi-currency support.

Frontend (React + Next.js) Requirements
Project Setup

Use Next.js for the React framework.

Set up Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.

Implement React hooks to handle state management for authentication, balance, and transaction states.

Pages & Components

Login Page:

Inputs for username and PIN.

Secure authentication handling and form validation.

Dashboard Page:

Display the user’s balance and transaction history.

Options to deposit and withdraw money.

Transaction History:

List of previous transactions with date, type (deposit/withdraw), and amount.

Receipt Generation:

Display or generate a downloadable receipt (e.g., PDF) after a transaction is made.

Features

Responsive Design: Make the app mobile-friendly.

Animations: Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions when moving between screens.

Error Handling: Show appropriate error messages for invalid PINs, insufficient funds, etc.

Currency Conversion (optional): Allow the user to view their balance in multiple currencies using a currency API (e.g., exchangerate-api).

API Integration

Random User Data: Use randomuser.me API for generating fake user profiles, including account details (name, email, balance, etc.).

Currency Exchange API: Integrate with a currency API to show the balance in multiple currencies.

Backend (Python) Requirements
API Setup

Use Flask or FastAPI for building the backend.

Implement a basic REST API to handle user authentication, transactions, and account data.

User Management

Use a JSON file or dictionary to simulate multiple users with different usernames, PINs, and balances.

Implement secure login by validating the PIN entered by the user.

Transaction Handling

Implement functions for:

Viewing balance.

Depositing and withdrawing money.

Recording transactions in a history log (stored in a JSON file).

Add validation for insufficient funds during withdrawal and ensure the balance can’t go negative.

Receipt Generation

After each transaction, provide a receipt (summary of transaction) which could be displayed on the frontend or generated as a PDF (optional).

Bonus Features

Currency Exchange: Integrate with a currency API to convert balances to multiple currencies.

Fake Data API: Use the randomuser.me API to populate user data and simulate a real banking experience.

Deployment Requirements
Frontend Deployment:

Deploy the Next.js app on Vercel for fast, optimized performance.

Backend Deployment:

Host the Flask or FastAPI backend on Heroku or within a serverless function in the Next.js API routes.

Documentation:

Write a comprehensive README to guide users on how to run the project locally.

Include setup instructions for both frontend and backend, along with features and technologies used.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI), JSON file (for data storage)

APIs: randomuser.me, exchangerate-api (optional for currency support)

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Heroku (Backend) or Next.js API Routes

Instructions for Replit:
Set up the frontend with React and Tailwind CSS in a Next.js app.

Create the backend using Flask or FastAPI to handle user authentication, transactions, and receipts.

Simulate multiple users and transaction histories using JSON or a Python dictionary.

Integrate with an API like randomuser.me to generate fake user data and display it on the frontend.

Add optional currency conversion using an API like exchangerate-api.

Deploy the project, ensuring a fast, responsive UI with smooth animations and a clean, professional design.
